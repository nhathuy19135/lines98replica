## Dependencies
Java Development Kit 11
## Installation
Download the zipped files and extract it. Then open the folder using an IDE (we used VS Code) to run the program, or launch the .bat file to run the program.
## Features
* 7 differently collored balls.
* A 9x9 board made by JFrame and JButton.
* A leaderboard.
* The undo function to undo the previous action.
## Description
* You have 7 kinds of ball with different collors (cyan, purple, blue, green, brown, red, yellow)
* Get 5 of them in line, then it will disappear
* The score increases by 5 every time a line of balls disappears
* The game ends when there are no space left on the board.
* [Dijkstra shortest path algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/) and [A* path finding algorithm](https://www.baeldung.com/java-a-star-pathfinding) is implemented for the selected ball to move into the correct position.
